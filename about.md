I'm a professional software engineer, with focusing primarily on distributed systems, data, and reliability. I currently work on the Maps Reliability team at [Uber](https://www.uber.com/). Previously, I was an early employee at [Shogun Enterprises](https://www.shoguninc.com/), where I built financial products for the home renovation industry. Prior to that, I finished a degree in Computer Science at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), during which time I interned at [Houzz](https://houzz.com), [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/), [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/).
