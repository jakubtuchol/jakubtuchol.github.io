This year, I'm aiming to read 52 books (one per week for a year). I'll be keeping track of this in this post.

## Books

1) [**Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS** by *Joby Warrick*][black_flags]

* A quick read, but a rather illuminating one. I picked this up mostly because of the Pulitzer win, but found an incredibly illuminating biography of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and a great history of the early days of ISIS.

2) [**The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism** by *Naomi Klein*][shock_doctrine]

* Klein's core argument is that governments (particularly the US) often use violence and catastrophic events to precede the introduction of free-market capitalism. Her argument is interesting, and I learned quite a lot about the world history of the past 50 years. I'm not sure I agree with many of her arguments, and she often seems to conflate correlation with causality, though her core argument is quite provocative.

3) [**The Stranger** by *Albert Camus*][stranger]

* I admit, I picked this primarily because I wanted something short to prepare before the next monster. It's a strange book, colored primarily by the detachment of Mersault, and his total detachment from the world. It will probably take a couple more reads to appreciate it fully, but for now, it merely remains disquieting rather than profound.

4) [**The Industries of the Future** by *Alec Ross*][industries]

* This was another quick read to balance out tearing through a 600+ page history of the CIA. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. Ross builds an inspiring and hugely optimistic view of the next 50 years, but does it in a way that's very well balanced. He focuses on the downsides of and roadblocks to many of the innovations he talks about in a way that's far more nuanced than most innovation-focused books. I loved this and would recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in technology and the future.
    * Also worth reading is a brutal critique of the book by a man who Ross refers to in the book as a "Luddite Harvard graduate student". Critique found [here][industries_critique].

5) [**Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** by *Tim Weiner*][legacy_ashes]

* An absolute riveting indictment of the CIA. Weiner is almost too relentless in examining every failure of the CIA, and the portrait that emerges is utterly scathing.

6) [**To Kill a Mockingbird** by *Harper Lee*][kill_mockingbird]

* Despite growing up in Alabama, I never read this book during all my years of primary schooling. It's pretty good, though the problem with such "classic" novels is that time and overexposure often robs them of their power. It's a good book, though not quite as riveting as its reputation suggests.

7) [**The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin** by *Masha Gessen*][man_face]

* I came into this book expecting something approaching a biography of Putin, but instead found a book-length account of his follies and abuses. Though I wish the book had been more focused and provided a bit more insight into Putin himself, I did learn quite a bit about modern Russian history (specifically incidents that may or may not have been ordered or perpetrated by Putin). I also wish this book had provided me with a bit more insight into the current state and pulse of Russian society with relation to Putin, but I'll settle for the book-length polemic agains the Putin regime that I found.
