This year, I'm aiming to read 52 books (one per week for a year). I'll be keeping track of this in this post.

## Books

1) [**Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS** by *Joby Warrick*](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Flags-Rise-Joby-Warrick/dp/0804168938)

* A quick read, but a rather illuminating one. I picked this up mostly because of the Pulitzer win, but found an incredibly illuminating biography of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and a great history of the early days of ISIS.

2) [**The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism** by *Naomi Klein*](https://www.amazon.com/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0312427999)

* Klein's core argument is that governments (particularly the US) often use violence and catastrophic events to precede the introduction of free-market capitalism. Her argument is interesting, and I learned quite a lot about the world history of the past 50 years. I'm not sure I agree with many of her arguments, and she often seems to conflate correlation with causality, though her core argument is quite provocative.

3) [**The Stranger** by *Albert Camus*](https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Albert-Camus/dp/0679720200)

* I admit, I picked this primarily because I wanted something short to prepare before the next monster. It's a strange book, colored primarily by the detachment of Mersault, and his total detachment from the world. It will probably take a couple more reads to appreciate it fully, but for now, it merely remains disquieting rather than profound.

4) [**The Industries of the Future** by *Alec Ross*]()

* This was another quick read to balance out tearing through a 600+ page history of the CIA. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. Ross builds an inspiring and hugely optimistic view of the next 50 years, but does it in a way that's very well balanced. He focuses on the downsides of and roadblocks to many of the innovations he talks about in a way that's far more nuanced than most innovation-focused books. I loved this and would recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in technology and the future.

5) [**Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** by *Tim Weiner*]()

* This book is utterly brilliant.
