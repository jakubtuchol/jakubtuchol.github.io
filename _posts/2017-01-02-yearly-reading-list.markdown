This year, I'm aiming to read 52 books (one per week for a year). I'll be keeping track of this in this post.

## Books

1) [**Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS** by *Joby Warrick*][black_flags]

* A quick read, but a rather illuminating one. I picked this up mostly because of the Pulitzer win, but found an incredibly illuminating biography of Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi and a great history of the early days of ISIS.

2) [**The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism** by *Naomi Klein*][shock_doctrine]

* Klein's core argument is that governments (particularly the US) often use violence and catastrophic events to precede the introduction of free-market capitalism. Her argument is interesting, and I learned quite a lot about the world history of the past 50 years. I'm not sure I agree with many of her arguments, and she often seems to conflate correlation with causality, though her core argument is quite provocative.

3) [**The Stranger** by *Albert Camus*][stranger]

* I admit, I picked this primarily because I wanted something short to prepare before the next monster. It's a strange book, colored primarily by the detachment of Mersault, and his total detachment from the world. It will probably take a couple more reads to appreciate it fully, but for now, it merely remains disquieting rather than profound.

4) [**The Industries of the Future** by *Alec Ross*][industries]

* This was another quick read to balance out tearing through a 600+ page history of the CIA. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. Ross builds an inspiring and hugely optimistic view of the next 50 years, but does it in a way that's very well balanced. He focuses on the downsides of and roadblocks to many of the innovations he talks about in a way that's far more nuanced than most innovation-focused books. I loved this and would recommend it to anyone with a passing interest in technology and the future.
    * Also worth reading is a brutal critique of the book by a man who Ross refers to in the book as a "Luddite Harvard graduate student". Critique found [here][industries_critique].

5) [**Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA** by *Tim Weiner*][legacy_ashes]

* An absolute riveting indictment of the CIA. Weiner is almost too relentless in examining every failure of the CIA, and the portrait that emerges is utterly scathing.

6) [**To Kill a Mockingbird** by *Harper Lee*][kill_mockingbird]

* Despite growing up in Alabama, I never read this book during all my years of primary schooling. It's pretty good, though the problem with such "classic" novels is that time and overexposure often robs them of their power. It's a good book, though not quite as riveting as its reputation suggests.

7) [**The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin** by *Masha Gessen*][man_face]

* I came into this book expecting something approaching a biography of Putin, but instead found a book-length account of his follies and abuses. Though I wish the book had been more focused and provided a bit more insight into Putin himself, I did learn quite a bit about modern Russian history (specifically incidents that may or may not have been ordered or perpetrated by Putin). I also wish this book had provided me with a bit more insight into the current state and pulse of Russian society with relation to Putin, but I'll settle for the book-length polemic against the Putin regime that I found.

8) [**Submission** by *Michel Houellebecq*][submission]

* This book is nuts. It's a picture of a man who is completely lost and detached from the world outside him. While I was expecting this to play out much like Thomas Bernhard's *The Loser*, the way in which the narrator is drawn into political events around him turns it into something which I cannot completely grasp. I have read very few books with this much intelligence and guts.

9) [**The Corrections** by *Jonathan Franzen*][corrections]

* This is my second or third read of this book, and it remains one of the best novels I have ever read. It's psychedelic, all-encompassing, a bit unreadable at points (there are only so many times I want to read about Alfred Lambert wetting himself). But it's also generous and creates characters that I legitimately cared deeply about. And it also manages to wring emotion from the unlikeliest of places. Definitely worth the reread.

10) [**Modern Romance** by *Aziz Ansari*][modern_romance]

* Well that was unexpected. I picked up this book expecting to get a breezy humor book, but instead found a suprisingly thoughtful and thorough examination of how technology and modern life are changing love and romance. I was surprised at how much time and effort Ansari put into this, even recruting a sociologist to be co-author. A quick and worthwhile read, and one that I learned a thing or two from. Who knows, maybe it's time to up my Tinder game?

11) [**Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life** by *William Finnegan*][barbarian_days]

* This is one of the most extraordinary books I have ever read. It's rare to read something that's so clearly about a subject that the author is completely obsessed with. Finnegan writes about a life that is so well-lived that it is inspiring. He also seems to have an extraordinary ability to remember every detail of seemingly every wave that he ever surfed. It's not often that someone else's passion can feel so life-changing and life-affirming, but that's ultimately what this book is: a life-length love letter to a little-understood art.

12) [**Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right** by *Arlie Russell Hochschild*][strangers_land]

* Another day, another incredible book. Hochschild, despite being the classic liberal stereotype (Berkeley sociology professor), went into Louisiana for 5 years and came out of it with one of the most moving and illustrative books about the South ever written. Within the space of about 240 pages, Hochschild explains Southern attitudes towards business, the environment, religion, and so much more. In particular, the 11th chapter is an extraordinary account of the beliefs of conservatives that it had me in tears. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to understand the other side of the political spectrum.

13) [**Playing to the Edge: American: Intelligence in the Age of Terror** by *Michael Hayden*][playing_edge]

* Michael Hayden is a man who does not pull a whole lot of punches. In this incredible memoir, he tells his side of the story as one of the most senior officials in the US intelligence community during the Bush Administration. While I've heard and read mountains criticizing various programs put in place and continued under Hayden, it's fascinating to hear his accounts of these programs. And it's equally fascinating to see how both sides of the story are essentially right. Yes, many of the programs Hayden oversaw and put in place argualy paved the way for the erosion of American civil liberties and America's moral standing internationally. Yes, these programs may have been the best possible choices taken by experienced men and women who wanted nothing more than to serve and protect their country in extraordinary and trying circumstances. It seems that the controversy surrounding many of these issues may be the reason why this book can't seem to get a single fair review, but that doesn't mean it's not worth reading.

14) [**Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis** by *J. D. Vance*][hillbilly_elegy]

* This book hit hard. While I'm not sure I completely agree with Vance's "pick yourself up by the bootstraps" message to the American working class, I found large chunks of his story almost uncomfortably familiar. It's a hell of a book, and a hell of a life.
