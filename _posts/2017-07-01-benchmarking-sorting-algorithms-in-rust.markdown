Every algorithms textbook includes a robust discussion of sorting algorithms, with the associated big-O runtimes. While it's very easy to be able to point to these asymptotic runtime analyses as the final word on the performance of these sorting algorithms, I was very interested in determining whether or not these theoretical analyses actually described real runtime performance.

# The Algorithms

We will be working with five classic sorting algorithms:

* insertion sort
* quick sort
* merge sort
* heapsort
* bubble sort
* shell sort

# Runtime Characteristics

# Implementations

## Insertion Sort
